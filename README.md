## Godot versions

- The [`master`](https://github.com/godotengine/tps-demo) branch is compatible with the latest stable Godot version (currently 3.2.x that is at least 3.2.2).
- If you are using an older version of Godot, use the appropriate branch for your Godot version:

  - [`3.2.1`](https://github.com/godotengine/tps-demo/tree/3.2.1) branch
  for Godot 3.2.0 or 3.2.1.
  - [`3.1`](https://github.com/godotengine/tps-demo/tree/3.1) branch
  for Godot 3.1.x.

**Note:** The repository is big and asset importing not well optimized yet,
so expect a high wait time when opening the project for the first time.

## Git LFS

Git LFS is no longer required for the current master branch.
You only need Git LFS if you are checking out the 3.1 or 3.2.1 branches.
Those branches have instructions for Git LFS in their README files.
